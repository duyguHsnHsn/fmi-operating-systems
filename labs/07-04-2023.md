# Notes

- if you want to use files to save information it is best to use mktemp
- try running the whole script after every line since there can be syntax errors eetc

Check the solution for 2023-se-03 in the 2023-se dir.
Modify it and fix small errors -> the idea for the solution is good.

- check sha256sum 
- check how date and formatting dates work 
- check more regex
