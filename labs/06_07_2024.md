# Notes from 7th of June 

- while(WAIT(child) > 0) -> do not do it in the exam, we are doing it in the labs only; in exam count the number of child processes and use it for the wait
- in child processes we get the copies of the elements from the parent; we do not work with shared memory (ther eis a way to use shared memory but it is not for this course)
